*Run, hide, fight!*

***WallBang*** is a 3D multiplayer first-person shooter game developed by me in the XVR Framework.  
As in every FPS game, you gotta run across the map and kill the enemy players before they do the same to you.

## Installation and configuration

First, install the [XVR Studio](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xvrstudio/) development environment.  

Clone this project and import it in XVR. Then, edit the `config.s3d` file changing the player ID 
to a unique number (must be lower than number of players) and the networking parameters (IP and port)
according to your net topology.  
Make sure no two players have the same ID!
